        <h2>üåÆ Work History</h2>

        <h3>Covid Panademic</h3>
        <p>
          During the pandemic, I proudly volunteered my time and expertise to support COVID-19 relief efforts. I worked tirelessly with healthcare teams to provide assistance and care to those affected by the virus, emphasizing the importance of public health measures and ensuring access to essential resources.

        </p>
        <h3>Filed Tour</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most rewarding experiences during this time was conducting a household survey in the village of Taker. With a commitment to understanding the local community's needs, I led a comprehensive survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on households. Through this initiative, we gathered valuable data to identify vulnerabilities, provide targeted aid, and develop appropriate strategies for mitigating the pandemic's effects.
          This volunteer experience reinforced my belief in the power of community-driven efforts and the significance of public health research in shaping effective interventions. It was a humbling and enlightening experience, which further fueled my determination to pursue a career dedicated to improving the health and well-being of individuals and communities.


        </p>
        <h3>Shankharapur Hospital</h3>
        <p>
          I had the honor of serving at Shankharapur Hospital as a Health Assistant and OT (Operating Theater) rounder.
          During my fulfilling 8-month tenure at Shankharapur Hospital, I had the opportunity to be part of a passionate healthcare team. As a Health Assistant, I provided crucial medical support to patients, ensuring they received quality care and attention. Whether it was conducting medical assessments, administering treatments, or assisting with various medical procedures, I always prioritized the well-being of the patients.
          Moreover, my role as an OT rounder allowed me to be involved in critical surgical procedures, supporting the surgical team and ensuring the smooth functioning of the operating theater. Being a part of these life-changing moments further deepened my understanding of the importance of medical collaboration and precision.
          Throughout my time at Shankharapur Hospital, I embraced each day as a learning opportunity, striving to enhance my skills and knowledge to better serve those in need. The experience solidified my dedication to the field of healthcare and reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and growth.
